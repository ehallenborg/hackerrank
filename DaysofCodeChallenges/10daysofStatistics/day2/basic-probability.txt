Objective
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. Check out the Tutorial tab for a breakdown of probability fundamentals!


Task
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.

36 events possible with 2 dice

Answer: 5/6

1 - P(=10) - P(=11) - P(=12)
1 - (3/36)- (2/36) - (1/36) = 30/36 = 5/6
