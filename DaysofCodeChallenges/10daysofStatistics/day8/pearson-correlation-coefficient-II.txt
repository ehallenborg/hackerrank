The regression line of y on x is 3x + 4y + 9 = 0, 
and the regression line of x on y is 4x + 3y + 7 = 0. 

What is the value of the Pearson correlation coefficient?

Answer: -3/4

y = a1 + b1x

x = a2 + b2y

b1 = (pearson_correlation)*(Y_standard_deviation/X_standard_deviation)

b2 = (pearson_correlation)*(X_standard_deviation/Y_standard_deviation)

if b1 == b2:
    X_standard_deviation = Y_standard_deviation
    pearson_correlation = b1 = b2
