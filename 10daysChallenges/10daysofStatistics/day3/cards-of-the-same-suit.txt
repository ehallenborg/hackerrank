Task
You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

Answer: 12/51

1st draw: any card works - don't have to limit options by suit (52/52)
2nd draw: has to match the first drawn card's suit - only 12 of those suits are left in a deck of now 51 cards (12/51)
